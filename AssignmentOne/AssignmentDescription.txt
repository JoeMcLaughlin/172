Create a new Empty Web site. Add a Web Form. 
For this site a user should enter their name and date of birth. 
When they click a button the page will return how old they are in years, 
months and days, and provide some clever comment based on their 
age (for example, one comment for everyone who is over 50, another for those in their 40's, etc.) 
Add a CSS style sheet to make some changes to the web page.
