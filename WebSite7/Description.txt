Do what you can with this. I am not going to be strict about the points here. Just do what you can in the time remaining.

This project will review much of what we have learned. You can use elements of previous assignments such as the login. 

We will build the website from the fan's perspective. 

[ ] - We want the fan to be able to: 
[ ] - register
[ ] - log in

Once logged in they should be able to:
[ ] - select genres to follow
[ ] - select artists to follow 
Create a WCF service for this.

[ ] - Create a WCF service to allow these searches. 
[ ] - search for shows by artist or genre or venue. 
[ ] - Register the services with the web page.


Add at least Two elements the we have not discussed in class. These can be controls or something like Master Pages.
[ ] - #1
[ ] - #2



The web site should have a CSS style sheet that styles some of its elements.

I would suggest working with one or more people on this project.
