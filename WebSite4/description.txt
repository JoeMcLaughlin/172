This project will review much of what we have learned. 
You can use elements of previous assignments such as the login.

We will build the website from the fan's prespective. 
We want the fan to be able to register and log in. 
Once logged in they should be able to select genres and artists they want to follow. 
Create a WCF service for this

The fan should be able to serach for shows by artist or genre or venue. 
Create a WCF service to allow these searches. 
Register the services with the web page.

Add at least Two elements that we have not discussed in class. 
These can be controls or something like MasterPages

The website should have a CSS style sheet that styles some of its elements.
